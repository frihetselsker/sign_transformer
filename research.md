# Research of Transformer Architecture

I have started studying it from scratch. I am using this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRdUbdhHjy0&list=PLNg09XqZv0dEWPpb1jJf8woP3cl_boYWZ&index=1).

While watching these videos, I will take some notes.

## 1. Neural Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptrons
Perceptron = all the connections between neurons and bias

Activation function loves non-linearity:
1. Sigmoid
2. tanh
3. ReLU

Multi-layer perceptron is a forward-pass function, i.e. it performs unidirectionally.

Tensor = scalars, vectors, matrices
